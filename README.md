# House-Price-Prediction
This project is about predicting house prices using machine learning. It takes data like house size, location, number of rooms, and other features to estimate the price. The project cleans the data, picks the most important factors, and then tests different AI models (like regression and decision trees) to see which predicts prices best. The best model is chosen based on accuracy. In the end, the project discusses what worked well, what could be improved, and possible future upgrades.
